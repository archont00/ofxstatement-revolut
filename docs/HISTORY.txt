- Use ATM types for ATM events, XFER type for EXCHANGE operations, and add FEE type (thanks @3v1n0)
- Handle empty balance fields (thanks @3v1n0)

2.0.2
-----
- Ignore other than COMPLETED transactions. Pending transactions have their own structure in OFX
  called STMTTRNP, but ofxstatement doesn't support it.
- Include the "Started Date" as the date the user initiated the transaction.

1.6.0
-----

- Since version 0.6.5 ofxstatement requires a statement line to have either id, refnum or check_no. To avoid failing
  the conversion, there's now a unique MD5 hashed ID computed from the date, payee, amount and balance.
